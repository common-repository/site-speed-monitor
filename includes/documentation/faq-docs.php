						<dd class="answer hidden">Answer: <br />
							<p><em>Yes! Head into the Site Speed Monitor settings page and click on the "Test Parameters" tab at the top. Once the page loads, you can add custom test parameters here based on the WebPageTest.org API. One such parameter is "runs", which is the number of times a given test will run before returning the results. Settings "runs" to 2 will run the speed test twice, average the load times and return the results.</em></p>
